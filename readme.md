## Messenger chat bot for student timetable

With @PierrLouis2, we created a chat bot for Messenger to help students to get their timetable on messenger which is much eassier than a long and fastidious excel file. 
That's why we created [Emploi du temps Ã©tudiant | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090431688914). 
It's a 24/7 chat bot running with Nodejs on our personnal home lab.

The first version was made by @waleedahmad with his [Aww-Bot | Github](https://github.com/waleedahmad/Aww-Bot).

# Installation

Fist you need a Facebook page connected with messenger to get a personnal token. Then you need to create a server with an https address (you can use `ngrok`, `localtunnel`, or a personnal domain). Then run a nodejs server (I first tried with python... no sucess) where the url `/webhook` verify the token. Finally your chat bot can be used.

# Usage

The **get_started** button is the first thing you see when you open the chat bot. It's a simple button that register the user in the database while asking for his promotion and groupa and Major if necessary.
For the database, are we using a simple json file ?, an sqlite database ? or a docker database ? ? ? We don't know yet.  
We are reccording the user's :
 - id
 - promotion
 - group
 - major 
 - name
 - username
 - firstname
 - lastname.

Then we send to the user a message with a button for each day of the week. When the user click on a button, we send him a message with the timetable of the day according to his promotion and group.
