## Messenger chat bot for student timetable

With @PierrLouis2, we created a chat bot for Messenger to help students to get their timetable on messenger which is much eassier than a long and fastidious excel file. 
That's why we created [Emploi du temps Ã©tudiant | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090431688914). 
It's a 24/7 chat bot running with Nodejs on our personnal home lab.

The first version was made by @waleedahmad with his [Aww-Bot | Github](https://github.com/waleedahmad/Aww-Bot).

# Installation

Fist you need a Facebook page connected with messenger to get a personnal token. Then you need to create a server with an https address (you can use `ngrok`, `localtunnel`, or a personnal domain). Then run a nodejs server (I first tried with python... no sucess) where the url `/webhook` verify the token. Finally your chat bot can be used.
